Recative Studio is a comprehensive tool to help creators manage their Recative
project. The tool can automatically manage trivial tasks like compatibility
fixing, resource management, internationalization, resource loading management,
resource deployment, and application bundling.

The goal of Recative Studio is to design a universal media creation
platform for non-developers. And we are now focusing on polishing various
functions related to project management.
